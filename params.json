You can find it here: http://www.poweradmin.com/paexec/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n-----------\r\n- transmit mouse and keyboard inputs to slaves\r\n- auto switch keyboard layout (lang) on slaves to the layout used on master\r\n- auto resize software's window on slaves as same size of the window on master.\r\n- take control of a single slave at any time\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to\r\n--------\r\n\r\nYou should have 2 differents computers. On the one with the bigger screen, launch ShivaQEviewer.exe\r\nClick \"Add\". Fill the fields.\r\nGive Ip or hostname of the slave VM, you can add a Hostname but it's optionnal.\r\nGive windows credentials. If you dont specify a domain in the login textbox, default is \"localhost\".\r\nTo specify a domain, prefix the login with you domain and separate it with a backslash. ie: domain\\login\r\nClick \"Add\". The slave should appear in the list. If you want to have more slaves, add it as we just did.\r\nWhen you are done, click on \"View\". A resolution is asked, put the one of your computer with the smaller screen (which will be your master computer).\r\nClick \"OK\". All computers open with RDP.\r\n\r\n\r\nStart ShivaQEmaster.exe on the computer you want to control.\r\nIts easier if this computer is a VM you're connected on with remote desktop (rdp) from your physical computer that has the smallest screen.\r\nSpecify IP or localhost in ip textbox. Friendly name is optional. Click \"Add\".\r\nSlave should appear in the list and should automatically be connected to master.\r\nOn the slave's systray (near the clock in the windows task bar), a small icon with a mouse should be orange if connected, grey otherwise.\r\nYou can remove a slave with the button \"Remove\". Button \"Reconnect\" tries to reconnect all slaves.\r\nIf \"Live broadcast\" switch is On, keyboard and mouse input are transmitted, if \"Live broadcast\" is Off, no activity is replicated to slaves.\r\n\"mouse movement\" checkbox disable mouse movement transmission if checked.\r\nMouse movement are not necessary because position of the mouse is transmitted on click. Mouse movement is just here for the beauty.\r\nShivaQEmaster comes with few shortcuts.\r\nDouble press key:\r\n- F5 to start transmission\r\n- F6 to stop transmission\r\n- F7 force resize of slave's active window to take the size of the active window on Master\r\n- F8 to hide or show ShivaQEMaster.exe's window\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the Hood\r\n--------\r\n\r\nShivaQEviewer is a deployer to inject to slaves computer the program that allow them to be controlled (shivaQEslave).\r\nShivaQEviewer uses paexec a redistribuable alternative to psexec to automatically start shivaQEslave\r\nShivaQEmaster send data through TCP execpt for mouse movement that are transmitted with udp.\r\nShivaQE uses libraries listed in \"Projects that made ShivaQE possible\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther uses\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThere's potentially many other uses than manual testing.\r\n\r\nOne of them is the streaming of a computer' screen through RDP for a demo.\r\nWith RDP you can't stay logged to a same computer from 2 different computers.\r\nWith ShivaQE you could open a replica (a slave) on the computer used to show the presentation and altogether make the demo from your \"master\"\r\nFor the audience of your demo it will be as if you were streaming your screen.\r\n\r\nAnother idea is to administrate a park of computers graphically.\r\n\r\n\r\nWho uses it\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nSome folks uses ShivaQE at SAP.\r\nI made this software on my spare time (holidays, weekends, evenings) to use it at work for repetitive tasks.\r\nI work on an old software that is in maintenance and rarely changes its UI.\r\nSome tests must be run manually and on different versions of the software (sometimes it can go up to 8 or +)\r\nShivaQE makes me gain time to focus on other less repetitive and time expansive tasks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProjects that made ShivaQE possible\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\n- GlobalCbtHook\r\n- MahApps.Metro\r\n- MouseKeyboardActivityMonitor\r\n- Newtonsoft.Json\r\n- paexec\r\n- SimpleImpersonation\r\n- WindowsInput\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n---------\r\n\r\nGNU General Public License (GPLv3)\r\n","google":"UA-57662843-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
